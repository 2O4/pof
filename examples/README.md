# Pof examples

In this directory you'll find 2 files, the source and then generator file. The source file `source.py` contains the Python source file to obfuscate, and the generator file `gen.py` contain the obfuscator code. All outputs are produce to the `out/` directory.

This is useful to test pof, get a feel for the Python API, and how to use it, but also with some outputs and test the result.

Note that you'll need to install pof first.
